# hangman
Hangman with file word list support, and dash- and space-awareness.  
The file needs to be named `randomwords.txt`.

By default, number of lives will be the same as the number of non-symbol characters in the word. For example:  
`asexuality`: 10 lives  
`ill-fated`: 8 lives  
`ad hoc`: 5 lives
